thank you for teaching this and made me do it.

## Requirements

Alright, now it’s time to make your website your own. Design a personal webpage about yourself, one of your interests, or any other topic of your choice. The subject matter, look and feel, and design of the site are entirely up to you, subject to the following requirements:

  * Your website must contain at least four different .html pages, and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
  **OK - site consists of four pages. See links at top**
  * Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.
  **OK - click around.**
  * Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.
  **OK - see main.css**
  * Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
  **OK - see main.css**
  * Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
  **OK - the Requiremens and Status divs on this page will stack under 900 pixels. They also stack and unstack on mobile (S8) between portrait and landscape orientation.**
  * You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model.
  **OK - used Bootstrap 4, bootstrap nav, and grid model**
  * Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
  **OK - So, I was totally annoyed that I had to figure out scss and <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">sass</a> on a first web project, but now that I did I realize it's pretty sweet. Totally worth it.**
  * In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.
